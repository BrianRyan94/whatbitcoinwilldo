# whatbitcoinisdoing
Simple website for displaying real time information for what bitcoin is doing - displays secondary features such as trailing volatility, the volume traded across intervals vs normal, and the average trade size across recent time periods.  

Website developed using Python for data logging and secondary feature creation, Django & React for the web application framework. I focused on creating a simple and modern looking web application, making significant use of Material UI and the Nivo charting package.

Note, I took this website down as it was costing some $$ and not making any, but it did get some good feedback during its brief existence (see this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mvk16e/i_wanted_a_quick_way_to_go_somewhere_and_figure/)
